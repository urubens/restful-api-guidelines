[#100]
== {MUST} follow API first principle

You must follow the <<api-first, API First Principle>>, more specifically: 

* You must define APIs first, before coding its implementation, <<101, using
  Open API as specification language>>
* You must design your APIs consistently with this guidelines
* You must call for early review feedback from peers and client developers.


[#101]
== {MUST} provide API specification using Open API

We use the http://swagger.io/specification/[Open API specification] as standard
to define API specification files. API designers are required to provide the API
specification using a single *self-contained YAML* file to improve readability.
We use *Open API 3.0* version.

The API specification files should be subject to version control using a source
code management system - best together with the implementing sources.

*Hint:* A good way to explore *Open API 3.0/2.0* is to navigate through the
https://openapi-map.apihandyman.io/[Open API specification mind map] and use
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?search=swagger+Monte[Zalando Swagger Plugin
for IntelliJ IDEA] to create your first API. To explore and validate/evaluate
existing APIs the https://editor.swagger.io/[Swagger Editor].

*Hint:* We do not (yet) provide guidelines for https://graphql.org/[GraphQL].
We focus on resource oriented HTTP/REST API style
(and related tooling and infrastructure support) for general purpose
peer-to-peer microservice communication. Here, we think that GraphQL has no
major benefits, but a couple of downsides compared to REST. However, GraphQL
can provide a lot of value for specific target domain problems, especially
backends for frontends (BFF) and mobile clients.


[#234]
== {MUST} only use durable and immutable remote references

Normally, API specification files must be *self-contained*, i.e. files
should not contain references to local or remote content, e.g. `../fragment.yaml#/element` or
`$ref: 'https://github.com/zalando/zally/blob/master/server/src/main/resources/api/zally-api.yaml#/schemas/LintingRequest'`.
The reason is, that the content referred to is _in general_ *not durable* and
*not immutable*. As a consequence, the semantic of an API may change in
unexpected ways.

However, you may use remote references to resources accessible by the following
service URLs.

* `https://opensource.zalando.com/problem/` (see <<176>>)
* `https://zalando.github.io/problem/` (deprecated alias for <<176>>)

As we control these URLs, we ensure that their content is *durable* and
*immutable*. This allows to define API specifications by using fragments
published via this sources, as suggested in <<151>>.


[#102]
== {SHOULD} provide API user manual

In addition to the API Specification, it is good practice to provide an API
user manual to improve client developer experience, especially of engineers
that are less experienced in using this API. A helpful API user manual
typically describes the following API aspects:

* API scope, purpose, and use cases
* concrete examples of API usage
* edge cases, error situation details, and repair hints
* architecture context and major dependencies - including figures and
sequence flows

The user manual must be published online, e.g. via a documentation hosting
platform service, or specific team web servers. Please do not forget
to include a link to the API user manual into the API specification using the
`#/externalDocs/url` property.


[#103]
== {MUST} write APIs using U.S. English
